# I. Create App Specification

I need to write a software specification, and I need your help with writing it.

I want to build a flashcards app to help learn key English words in PMP in the form of a web application using TypeScript and Vite/React.

## Features
- Each card should be in English, and I need to know the word in Vietnamese with an example of using this word in a PMP context.
- Ability to flip cards revealing the word in Vietnamese.
- After flipping, below each card, I should have two buttons to indicate if I got it wrong or right.
- Remember which cards I got wrong.
- Feature to redo only cards I don't know.
- Quiz/Test Mode: Multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank options.
- Statistics page: Track how many cards you've studied, correct vs. incorrect answers.

The output should be formatted as Markdown.

> Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear BEFORE you start generating.

# III. Create TODO List to Implement One Feature at a Time

Create a TODO list to help implement one feature at a time. Order the features from easy to hard. The output should be in Markdown format.

For each item in the list, also define acceptance criteria.

---

# IV. Build the First Feature

Use the software requirements (`pmp-flashcards-spec.md`) and the TODO list (`TODO.md`) to complete Phase 1 of the project in the current directory.

Mark items as done in the TODO list only after verifying that the acceptance criteria have been met.

---

# V. Add Git to the Project

Add Git to this project.

# VI. Add New Feature (Phase 2 - Only First 2 Features to Test)

Use the software requirements and the TODO list to work on Phase 2 of the project. Build the first 2 features listed there. Mark in the TODO list the items that are done.

# VII. Adding Automated Tests

## Ask Kind of Testing
What kind of test does it make sense to write for this app?

_Result: (Unit test / Component test / Integration test / E2E test)_

## Write E2E Test
For the functionality implemented so far, write E2E tests using Playwright.
